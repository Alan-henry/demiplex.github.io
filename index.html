      <h1 id="col">What is DemiPlex?</h1>
      <p id="para" >DemiPlex is a step closer to the Future. it is an A.I based smart locality wherein everything is released from manual labour
        and is controlled by the artificial intelligence thus making it more reliadble and affordable as there is very little to no scope of errors so you the residants
        can be carefree of any sort of dangers that might have been prevelant in a manually operated environment.

        Here at DemiPlex we prioratize the safety of our residents thus leading us to utilise tech such motion capturing home security systems which in your absence
        can sence any sort of motion and notify you about it and thereafter you can access your security cameras and check out what the matter is. <br>

        We believe in making earth greener thus using renuable sources of energy for our tech such as sunlight to power the majority of our A.I based technology.
        For more information about the tech that we use go through the links given under "What tech do we use?". Get a place of your own <a href="">now</a>.

      <h1>Places where we use A.I</h1>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Security:</b>  We use motion detector technology to sense any sort of
        motion in your absence and notify you abot it and thereafter you can use your 
      security camera to to check if everything is under control.</li>
      <li><b>Maintenance:</b> An A.I based maintenance cost calculator has been device
      which can calculate the amount of financial aid required to fix the damages or maintain the road according to the given circumstance</li>
      <li><b>Predicting Future Needs:</b> An A.I based calculator has been deviced which can based on the number of
      residents can calculate the future needs like the number of hospitals, schools, parks etc.</li>
      <li><b>Controlling Pollution:</b> A machine learning algoithm is uder development
      which can upon given data can analyse the amount of pollution done and the necessary measure to reduce the 
      amount of pollution.</li>
      <li><b>Parking System: </b>A distance ditector is used in all the parking spots in order
      to help with a fluid parking experience so that no damage is done while parking.</li>
      <li><b>Traffic Management: </b>A motion detector based A.I. has been implimented
      which can see if a vehical is not following the traffic rules (like running a red light) and can detect the velocity of vehical and 
      if it is over the speeding limit it takes a picture of the vehical's license plate and it can be later called
      in the court for a hearing and necessaryactions will be taken against them</li>
      <li><b>Energy Tracking:</b> A machine learning algorithm has beet put in place which can calculate the amount of energy used be it solar-powered, wind-powered
      or any form of source of elecytricity in order for us to set a budget for the upcoming years</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 >Why A.I based management?</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>It is more reliadble than manual labour.</li>
        <li>It is way cheaper as you only need routine maintenance thus reducing the tax by a significant amount.</li>
        <li>It uses renuable sources such as solar powered energy as its major source of energy to make earth greener.</li>
        <li>It can predict a more accurate measure of the future so that we can plan the budget accordingly.</li>
        <li>It can work tirelessly so no breaks requiried.</li>
        <li>It is a much safer alternative.</li>
